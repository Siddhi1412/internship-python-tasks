## 🔹 Project Overview
This mini-project is part of **Week 4: File Handling & Final Project** during my internship tasks.  
It focuses on:

- Reading and writing files (`.txt`, `.csv`)  
- Error handling and debugging techniques  
- Organizing code into multiple Python files  
- Building small hands-on applications that persist data  

All files are modular, well-structured, and can be run independently.

## 📚 Theory Concepts Practiced
I created a dedicated file `week4_file_theory_basic_with_code.py` to implement all the theory concepts covered in Week 4. This file helped me consolidate my understanding by practicing code for each concept:

- 📄 Reading from and writing to files (`.txt` and `.csv`)  
- 🗂️ Organizing code into multiple files and modules  
- ⚠️ Handling file-related errors using `try-except` blocks  
- 🐞 Basic debugging techniques  
- 🔗 Combining multiple concepts into small working programs  

**File:** [`week4_file_theory_basic_with_code.py`](./week4_file_theory_basic_with_code.py)

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice
For practical exercises, I created **separate Python files** to keep everything organized and modular:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 📥 [`save_user_data.py`](./save_user_data.py) | Saves user information to a file for persistent storage |
| 📓 [`diary_app.py`](./diary_app.py) | Simple diary application with daily entries saved to a file |
| 📊 [`read_csv.py`](./read_csv.py) | Reads and displays data from a CSV file |
| 🏆 [`quiz_game.py`](./quiz_game.py) | Quiz game that saves scores for tracking progress |
| ✅ [`todo_list.py`](./todo_list.py) | To-do list application with persistent storage between runs |
| ⚠️ [`error_handling.py`](./error_handling.py) | Demonstrates handling file-related errors gracefully |

> Each file is **independent** and can be run separately.

## 📝 Key Learnings & Takeaways
- 🐍 Efficient file reading/writing in Python  
- 📄 Working with multiple file formats (`.txt`, `.csv`)  
- 🗂️ Structuring projects into multiple Python files for readability & maintainability  
- 🐞 Debugging and error-handling techniques in real scenarios  
- 🔗 Integrating theory and practice to build functional, persistent applications

## ⚡ How to Run

**Step 1:** Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Siddhi1412/internship-python-tasks.git
```

**Step 2:** Navigate to the project folder 
```bash
cd Week4_FileHandling
```

**Step 3:** Run any Python script
```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

Replace <script_name> with the file you want to run, for example:
```bash
python save_user_data.py
```

**Step 4:** Follow the on-screen instructions for each application.

✅ Notes

week4_file_theory_basic_with_code.py contains all code snippets I practiced while learning theory concepts.

Hands-on files are independent and organized for clarity.

This structure helped me practice debugging, handle files efficiently, and organize a mini-project professionally.
