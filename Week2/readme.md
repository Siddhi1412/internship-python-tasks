# Week 2 — Control Flow & Data Structures

This folder contains all the Week 2 exercises and the final project for the internship.

## 📚 Concepts Covered
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Lists and list operations
- For loops and while loops
- Basic error handling using `try` / `except`

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice
All Week 2 practice tasks are completed inside **one file**:

- `week2_practice.py`  
  Includes:
  - Number guessing game  
  - Age categorizer  
  - Shopping list manager  
  - Multiplication table generator  
  - Simple login system  
  - List operations (`append`, `insert`, `remove`, `pop`, `sort`, `reverse`, `clear`, etc.)

## 🎯 Project — Student Grade Calculator
- `grade_calculator.py`  
  - Takes student marks (0–100)  
  - Calculates grade (A/B/C/D/F)  
  - Adds feedback comments  
  - Stores all results in a list of dictionaries  
  - Displays final summary of all students

## 💡 Notes
- All programs were tested using different inputs  
- This week focused heavily on logic building and understanding how loops and conditions work together
