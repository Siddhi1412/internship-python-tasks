# Week 3 — Functions & Dictionaries  
This folder contains all the Week 3 exercises and the Week 3 project for the internship.

## 📚 Concepts Covered
Functions and reusable code blocks  
Function parameters and return values  
Dictionaries and nested dictionaries  
String methods and formatting  
Local vs global variable scope  
Using Python’s built-in functions and modules  

## 🛠️ Hands-On Practice  
All Week 3 practice tasks are completed inside one file:

**week3_practice.py**  
Includes:  
- Common calculation functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide, percentage)  
- Multi-function currency converter  
- Student database system using dictionaries  
- Text analyzer (word count & character count)  
- Simple bank account system  
- Practice with string methods (upper, lower, split, title, strip, replace)  

## 🎯 Project — Contact Management System

Stores names and phone numbers with options to:
- Add contact  
- Search contact (case-insensitive)  
- Display all saved contacts  

## 💡 Notes  
All programs were tested using different inputs  
This week focused on building strong foundations in functions, dictionaries, and real-world problem solving
